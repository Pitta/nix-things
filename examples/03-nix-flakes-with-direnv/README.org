#+TITLE: Nix Flakes with direnv
#+AUTHOR: github.com/Pitta

A basic =flake.nix= that is activated upon navigation to the project directory.

* Use

From your terminal

1. Clone this repo and navigate to its root
2. On first navigation, you will get an error like:
   #+begin_src shell
     direnv: error /home/pitta/projects/nix-things/examples/03-nix-flakes-with-direnv/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
   #+end_src
3. Open and asses the contents of the =.envrc=
   - This is considered best practice to prevent malicious code execution
4. Once the =.envrc= is assesed, run  ~direnv allow~
   
After some nix processing, you should be dropped into your projects dev-shell.

** Validate

1. ~cd~ out of the project directory
2. Take note of the =direnv: unloading= message
3. ~cd~ back into the project directory

Should see =direnv= kick into gear, automatically enabling the nix flake.
