#+PROPERTY: header-args:nix :mkdirp yes

A basic =flake.nix= that when invoked by ~nix develop~ provides =node 20= as a system level dependency.

* Use

From your terminal

1. Clone this repo and navigate to its root
2. Run ~nix develop~

#+begin_quote
Note: if you get an error like this:

#+begin_src shell
  error: experimental Nix feature 'flakes' is disabled; use '--extra-experimental-features flakes' to override
#+end_src

That means these features are still locked behind an experimental flag. To address this, create a file at ~/etc/nix/nix.conf~, then add the following line to it:

#+begin_src shell
  experimental-features = nix-command flakes
#+end_src
#+end_quote
