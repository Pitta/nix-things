#+TITLE: Project Examples
#+AUTHOR: github.com/Pitta

Project Examples is meant to show how to build up a new or existing project to leverage ~nix~ and ~flakes~ to manage the developer environment and experience.

More examples will be added over time as more functionality is discovered.

* Running Project Examples

Clone this repo to run any of the examples to see and tinker with how they function.

#+begin_quote
Note: if you get an error like the one below when running ~nix~ commands:

#+begin_src shell
  error: experimental Nix feature 'flakes' is disabled; use '--extra-experimental-features flakes' to override
#+end_src

That means these features are still locked behind an experimental flag. To address this, create a file at ~/etc/nix/nix.conf~, then add the following line to it:

#+begin_src shell
  experimental-features = nix-command flakes
#+end_src
#+end_quote
