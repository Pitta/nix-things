* Nix Things

This is meant to serve as a collection of varios ways i've learned how to do a thing in =nix=.

* Running Examples

Clone this repo to run any of the examples to see and tinker with how they function.

#+begin_quote
Note: if you get an error like the one below when running ~nix~ commands:

#+begin_src shell
  error: experimental Nix feature 'flakes' is disabled; use '--extra-experimental-features flakes' to override
#+end_src

That means these features are still locked behind an experimental flag. To address this, create a file at ~/etc/nix/nix.conf~, then add the following line to it:

#+begin_src shell
  experimental-features = nix-command flakes
#+end_src
#+end_quote
